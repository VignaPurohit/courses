# Introduction 

QGIS allows you to define custom Actions on map layers. This action can run commands or python code when the user clicks on a feature. This workshop will cover QGIS Actions in detail along with demos on how you can harness its power to automate GIS workflows. We will focus on Python Actions and go through various examples of implementing new functionality and automating tasks with just a few lines of PyQGIS code.

This workshop requires prior knowledge of Python and familiarity with PyQGIS API.

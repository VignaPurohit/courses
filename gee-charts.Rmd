# Introduction 

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that enables large-scale processing of satellite imagery to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earthâ€™s surface. This course covers the full range of topics in Earth Engine to give the participants practical skills to master the platform and implement their remote sensing projects.

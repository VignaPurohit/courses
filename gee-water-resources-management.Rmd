# Introduction 

GIS and Remote Sensing plays a critical role in the management of water resources. Many practitioners in this field are constrained by the availability of tools and computing resources to use these techniques effectively. Recent advances in cloud computing technology have given rise to platforms such as Google Earth Engine, which provide free access to a large pool of computational resources and datasets. The course is designed for researchers in the water sector, academicians, water managers, and stakeholders with basic knowledge of Remote Sensing. It will enable them to leverage this platform for water resource management applications.

# Setting up the Environment

## Sign-up for Google Earth Engine

If you already have a Google Earth Engine account, you can skip this step.

Visit [https://signup.earthengine.google.com/](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/){target="_blank"} and sign-up with your Google account. You can use your existing gmail account to sign-up. It usually takes 1-2 days for approval. Hence do this step as soon as possible.

Tips to ensure smooth sign-up process:

- Use Google Chrome browser.
- When signing up for Earth Engine, please log out of all Google accounts and ensure you are logged into only 1 account which you want associated with Earth Engine. 
- Access to Google Earth Engine is granted via Google Groups. The default settings should be fine, but verify you have the correct setting enabled.
    - Visit [groups.google.com](http://groups.google.com/){target="_blank"}
    - Click on Settings (gear icon) and select Global Settings.
    - Make sure the option Allow group managers to add me to their groups is checked.

# Module 1: Google Earth Engine Fundamentals

Module 1 is designed to give you basic skills to be able to find datasets you need for your project, filter them to your region of interest, calculate remote sensing indices and export raster data.

## 01. Hello World

This script introduces the basic Javascript syntax and the video covers the programming concepts you need to learn when using Earth Engine. To learn more, visit [Introduction to JavaScript for Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_js_01) section of the Earth Engine User Guide. 

[![Video](images/gee_water_resources_management/intro_to_javascript.png){width="400px"}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV3Sv5iogHs){target="_blank"}

- [Watch the Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV3Sv5iogHs){target="_blank"}

The *Code Editor* is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Earth Engine Javascript API. It offers an easy way to type, debug, run and manage code. Type the code below and click *Run* to execute it and see the output in the *Console* tab.

> Tip: You can use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+Enter* to run the code in the Code Editor

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%', fig.cap='Hello World'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_water_resources_management/hello_world.png')
```

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/gee_water_resources_management/01-Earth_Engine_Basics/01b_Hello_World_(complete)')}
```

[Open in Code Editor &#8599;](https://code.earthengine.google.co.in/?scriptPath=users%2Fujavalgandhi%2FGEE-Water-Resources-Management%3A01-Earth_Engine_Basics%2F01b_Hello_World_(complete)){target="_blank"}

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/gee_water_resources_management/01-Earth_Engine_Basics/01c_Hello_World_(exercise)')}
```

### Saving Your Work

When you modify any script for the course repository, you may want to save a copy for yourself. If you try to click the *Save* button, you will get an error message like below

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_water_resources_management/setup1.png')
```

This is because the shared class repository is a *Read-only* repository. You can click *Yes* to save a copy in your repository. If this is the first time you are using Earth Engine, you will be prompted to choose the name of your *home folder*. Choose the name carefully, as it cannot be changed once created.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_water_resources_management/setup2.png')
```

## 02. Working with Image Collections

Most datasets in Earth Engine come as a `ImageCollection`. An ImageCollection is a dataset that consists of images takes at different time and locations - usually from the same satellite or data provider. You can load a collection by searching the [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) for the *ImageCollection ID*. Search for the *Sentinel-2 Level 1C* dataset and you will find its id `COPERNICUS/S2_SR`. Visit the [Sentinel-2, Level 1C page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2) and see *Explore in Earth Engine* section to find the code snippet to load and visualize the collection. This snippet is a great starting point for your work with this dataset. Click the **Copy Code Sample** button and paste the code into the code editor. Click *Run* and you will see the image tiles load in the map.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_water_resources_management/image_collection1.png')
```

In the code snippet, You will see a function `Map.setCenter()` which sets the viewport to a specific location and zoom level. The function takes the X coordinate (longitude), Y coordinate (latitude) and Zoom Level parameters ranging from 1 (whole world) to 22 (pixel level). Replace the X and Y coordinates with the coordinates of your city and click *Run* to see the images of your city.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_water_resources_management/image_collection2.png')
```

```

## 03. Filtering Image Collections

The collection contains all imagery ever collected by the sensor. The entire collections are not very useful. Most applications require a subset of the images. We use **filters** to select the appropriate images. There are many types of filter functions, look at `ee.Filter...` module to see all available filters. Select a filter and then run the `filter()` function with the filter parameters. 

We will learn about 3 main types of filtering techniques

* **Filter by metadata**: You can apply a filter on the image metadata using filters such as `ee.Filter.eq()`, `ee.Filter.lt()` etc. You can filter by PATH/ROW values, Orbit number, Cloud cover etc.
* **Filter by date**: You can select images in a particular date range using filters such as `ee.Filter.date()`.
* **Filter by location**: You can select the subset of images with a bounding box, location or geometry using the `ee.Filter.bounds()`. You can also use the drawing tools to draw a geometry for filtering.

After applying the filters, you can use the `.size()` function to check how many images match the filter criteria.

knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_water_resources_management/filters.png')
```

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/gee_water_resources_management/01-Earth_Engine_Basics/03b_Filtering_Image_Collection_(complete)')}
```

## 04. Mosaics and Composites

The default order of the collection is by date. So when you display the collection, it implicitly creates a mosaic with the latest pixels on top. You can call `.mosaic()` on a ImageCollection to create a mosaic image from the pixels at the top (i.e) first image in the stack.

We can also create a composite image by applying selection criteria to each pixel from all pixels in the stack. Here we use the `.median()` function to create a composite where each pixel value is the median of all pixels values at each pixel from the stack for all matching bands.

> Tip: If you need to create a mosaic where the images are in a specific order, you can use the `.sort()` function to sort your collection by a property first.

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/gee_water_resources_management/01-Earth_Engine_Basics/04b_Mosaics_and_Composites_(complete)')}
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Mosaic vs. Median Composite'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_water_resources_management/mosaic_median.png')
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE}
// Create a median composite for the year 2020 and load it to the map

// Compare both the composites to see the changes in your city
```

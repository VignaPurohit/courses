# Introduction 

This is an advanced-level course that teaches you how to use open-source Python libraries to process earth observation dataset using cloud and parallel-computing technologies. We have designed this course to help you build the required skills in a structured way and offer flexibility in where your data is stored and how it is processed. The course is divided into 3 sections.

1. Local Data Local Compute
2. Cloud Data Local Compute
3. Cloud Data Cloud Compute

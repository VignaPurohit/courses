# Introduction 

This is an introductory course that covers QGIS from the very basics. You will learn how to use QGIS for mapping, spatial data processing and spatial analysis. This class is ideal for participants with a basic knowledge of GIS and want to learn how to use QGIS carry out common GIS tasks.

# Software

This course requires QGIS LTR version 3.22. 

Please review [QGIS-LTR Installation Guide](install-qgis-ltr.html) for step-by-step instructions.

# Get the Data Package

The code examples in this class use a variety of datasets. All the required datasets and Jupyter notebooks are supplied to you in the ``python_dataviz.zip`` file. Unzip this file to a directory - preferably to the ``<home folder>/Downloads/introduction_to_qgis/`` folder. 

<!-- *Not enrolled in our instructor-led class but want to work through the material on your own?* [Get free access to the data package](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6TGQmr5w_QlDEgZ7QJrfuiRTu-aCuhfcNY_fYCU3zv9hHOg/viewform){target="_blank"} -->

# Georeferencing

Most GIS projects require Georeferencing some raster data. Georeferencing is the process of assigning real-world coordinates to each pixel of the raster. Many times these coordinates are obtained by doing field surveys - collecting coordinates with a GPS device for few easily identifiable features in the image or map. In some cases, where you are looking to digitize scanned maps with grid markings, you can obtain the coordinates from the markings on the map image itself. Using these sample coordinates or GCPs (Ground Control Points), the image is warped and made to fit within the chosen coordinate system. 

## Georeference a Scanned Map

In this exercise, you will learn the process and strategies to achieve a high accuracy georeferencing in QGIS. We will take a scanned map of Bangalore in 1924. This map is possibly hand-drawn, so scale and projection information is not available. We will use the OpenStreetMap basemap to identify coordinates of features from the scanned map and rectify the map to align with the basemap.


1. Open QGIS. Add the OpenStreetMap basemap from **Web &rarr; QuickMapServices &rarr; OSM &rarr; OpenStreetMap** layer. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img01.png')
```

2. Go to **Raster &rarr; Georeferencerâ€¦** 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img02.png')
```

3. The  *Georeferencer* window is divided into 2 sections. The top section where the image will be displayed and the bottom section where a table showing your GCPs will appear.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img03.png')
```

4. Go to **File &rarr; Open Raster**. Browse to the `Banglore_1924.png` and click Open.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img04.png')
```

5. The toposheet will be loaded on the top section. You can use the *Zoom/Pan* controls in the toolbar to learn more about the map.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img05.png')
```

6. To assign coordinates to reference points (ground reference points) on this map. Click the *Add points* button and click on a location that can be located in ```Openstreetmap```. Select **From Map Canvas**.

> Always select points from permament structures such as road intersections, junctions, big-building corners etc.. It is not advisable to georeference using the natural structure such as river edges, hill tops, etc. as they can change over time.
 
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img06.png')
```

7. Select a minimum of 6 GCPs for georeferencing, usually a higher number of GCPs will be useful in reducing the error. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img07.png')
```

8. Click on **Settings**, *Transformation type* as **Polynomial 2**, *Resampling method* as **Nearest neighbourhood**, *Target SRS* as *WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator EPSG : 3857*, *Output layer* as **Banglore_1924_modified.tif**. Also choose *LZW* as the *Compression* type,  Check *Save GCP Points* and *Load in QGIS* when done. And Click OK. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img08.png')
```

9. Now the GCPs now have a non-zero *dX, dY* and *Residual* error values. If a particular GCP has unusually high error values, that usually means a human-error in entering the coordinate values.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img09.png')
```

10. You can delete that GCP and capture it again. Repeat the process till the errors are acceptable.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img10.png')
```

11. Click the *Start Georeferencing* button to start georeferencing. This will start the process of warping the image using the GCPs and creating the target raster. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img11.png')
```

12. The georeferenced map will be loaded in main window as `Banglore_1924_modified` and can be validated with the `Openstreetmap` basemap in QGIS. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/introduction_to_qgis/reference_img12.png')
```

## Exercise

Change the *Transformation type* to **Thin Plate Spline** and run the georeferencing process again. Compare the results with the previous output.s


# Digitizing

Digitizing is one of the most common tasks that a GIS Specialist has to do. Often a large amount of GIS time is spent in digitizing raster data to create vector layers that you use in your analysis. Many machine learning projects also require creating labeled dataset that needs tyo be created by digitizing features from satellite imagery or historic maps. QGIS has powerful on-screen digitizing and editing capabilities that we will explore in this tutorial.

## Digitize Historic Lakes

We will take the georeferenced map created in the previous exercise and create a polygon layer representing the lakes in the city of Bengaluru in 1924. Bengaluru has experienced rapid urbanization and many of these historic lakes no longer exist. This exercise will allow you to create a vector layer and discover the lakes that are fully or partially lost.

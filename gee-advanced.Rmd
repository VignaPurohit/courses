# Introduction 

This is an advanced-level course that is suited for participants who are familiar with the Google Earth Engine API and want to learn advanced data processing techniques and understand the inner-workings in Earth Engine. This class covers the following topics:

* Reducers
* Joins
* Regressions
* Vector Data Processing and Visualization

# Sign-up for Google Earth Engine

If you already have a Google Earth Engine account, you can skip this step.

Visit our [GEE Sign-Up Guide](gee-sign-up.html) for step-by-step instructions.


# Get the Course Materials

The course material and exercises are in the form of Earth Engine scripts shared via a code repository.

1. [Click this link](https://code.earthengine.google.co.in/?accept_repo=users/ujavalgandhi/GEE-Advanced) to open Google Earth Engine code editor and add the repository to your account.
2. If successful, you will have a new repository named `users/ujavalgandhi/GEE-Advanced` in the *Scripts* tab in the *Reader* section.
3. Verify that your code editor looks like below

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%', fig.cap='Code Editor with Workshop Repository'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/gee_advanced/repository.png')
```
If you do not see the repository in the *Reader* section, click *Refresh repository cache* button in your *Scripts* tab and it will show up.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%', fig.cap='Refresh repository cache'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/common/repository_cache.png')
```

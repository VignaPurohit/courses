# Working with RasterIO

[RasterIO](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a modern library to work with geospatial data in a gridded format. It excels at providing an easy way to read/write raster data and access individual bands and pixels as `numpy` arrays.

RasterIO is built on top of the popular [GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)](https://gdal.org/). GDAL is written in C++ so the Python API provided by GDAL is not very intuitive for Python users. RaserIO aims to make it easy for Python users to use the underlying GDAL library in an intuitive way.

In this section, we will take 4 individual SRTM tiles around the Mt. Everest region and merge them to a single GeoTiff using RasterIO.

```python
import rasterio
```


```python
import os
data_pkg_path = 'data'
srtm_dir = 'srtm'
filename = 'N28E087.hgt'
path = os.path.join(data_pkg_path, srtm_dir, filename)
```

## Reading Raster Data

RasterIO can read any raster format supported by the GDAL library. We can call the `open()` method with the file path of the raster. The resulting dataset behaves much like Python's File object.


```python
dataset = rasterio.open(path)
```

You can check information about the raster using the `meta` attribute.

An important property is the dataset *transform*. The transform contains the pixel resolution of the dataset and the row and column coordinates of the upper left corner of the dataset.


```python
metadata = dataset.meta
metadata
```

To read the pixel values, we need to call the `read()` method by passing it a bandâ€™s index number. Following the GDAL convention, bands are indexed from 1. Since our dataset contain just 1-band, we can read it as follows.


```python
band1 = dataset.read(1)
print(band1)
```

Finally, when we are done with the dataset, we must close it. It is especially important when writing a dataset.


```python
dataset.close()
```

## Merging Datasets

Let's see how we can read the 4 individual tiles and mosaic them together. RasterIO provides multiple sub-modules for various raster operations. We can use the `rasterio.merge` module to carry out this operation.

We first find all the individual files in the directory using the `os.listdir()` function.


```python
srtm_path = os.path.join(data_pkg_path, 'srtm')
all_files = os.listdir(srtm_path)
print(all_files)
```

The rasterio.merge module has a `merge()` method that takes a list of *datasets* and returns the merged dataset. So we create an empty list, open each of the files and append it to the list.


```python
dataset_list = []
for file in all_files:
    path = os.path.join(srtm_path, file)
    dataset_list.append(rasterio.open(path))
print(dataset_list)
```

We can pass on the list of tile dataset to the merge method, which will return us the merged data and a new *transform* which contains the updated extent of the merged raster.


```python
from rasterio import merge
merged_result = merge.merge(dataset_list)
print(merged_result)
```

We save the data and the transform to separate variables.


```python
merged_data = merged_result[0]
merged_transform = merged_result[1]
```

Verify that the resulting array shape the sum of individual rasters


```python
print(merged_data.shape)
```

## Writing Raster Data

Similar to regular Python files, to create a new file, we can open the output file in the *write* mode. RasterIO provides a `write()` method that we can use to write individual bands.


```python
output_filename = 'merged.tif'
output_dir = 'output'
output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, output_filename)
```

We need to specify many metadata parameters to initialize the output dataset. Some of these parameter values can be directly copied from the input files, such as `crs`, `dtype`, `nodata` etc. , while others can be obtained from the merged dataset, such as `height` and `width`.

Remember to call the `close()` method which will finalize the file and write the data to disk.


```python
new_dataset = rasterio.open(output_path, 'w', 
                            driver='GTiff',
                            height=merged_data.shape[1],
                            width=merged_data.shape[2],
                            count=1,
                            nodata=-32768.0,
                            dtype=merged_data.dtype,
                            crs='+proj=latlong',
                            transform=merged_transform)
new_dataset.write(merged_data)
new_dataset.close()
print('Successfully written output file at {}'.format(output_path))
```

## Exercise

The merged array represents elevation values. The extent of the tiles cover Mt. Everest. Read the resulting raster and find the maximum elevation value contained in it.


```python
import rasterio
import os
import numpy as np

output_filename = 'merged.tif'
output_dir = 'output'
output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, output_filename)

# Read the output file as a NumPy array and find the maximum value
```

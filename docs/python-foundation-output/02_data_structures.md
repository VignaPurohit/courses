# Data Structures

## Tuples

A *tuple* is a sequence of objects. It can have any number of objects inside. In Python tuples are written with round brackets **()**. 


```python
latitude = 37.7739
longitude = -121.5687
coordinates = (latitude, longitude)
print(coordinates)
```

You can access each item by its position, i.e. *index*. In programming, the counting starts from 0. So the first item has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1 and so now. The index has to be put inside square brackets **[]**.


```python
y = coordinates[0]
x = coordinates[1]
print(x, y)
```

## Lists

A **list** is similar to a tuple - but with a key difference. With tuples, once created, they cannot be changed, i.e. they are immutable. But lists are mutable. You can add, delete or change elements within a list.  In Python, lists are written with square brackets **[]**


```python
cities = ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'New York', 'Atlanta']
print(cities)
```

You can access the elements from a list using index the same way as tuples.


```python
print(cities[0])
```

You can call `len()` function with any Python object and it will calculates the size of the object.


```python
print(len(cities))
```

We can add items to the list using the `append()` method


```python
cities.append('Boston')
print(cities)
```

As lists are *mutable*, you will see that the size of the list has now changed


```python
print(len(cities))
```

Another useful method for lists is `sort()` - which can sort the elements in a list.


```python
cities.sort()
print(cities)
```

The default sorting is in *ascending* order. If we wanted to sort the list in a *decending* order, we can call the function with `reverse=True`


```python
cities.sort(reverse=True)
print(cities)
```

## Sets

Sets are like lists, but with some interesting properties. Mainly that they contain only unique values. It also allows for *set operations* - such as *intersection*, *union* and *difference*. In practice, the sets are typically created from lists.


```python
capitals = ['Sacramento', 'Boston', 'Austin', 'Atlanta']
capitals_set = set(capitals)
cities_set = set(cities)

capital_cities = capitals_set.intersection(cities_set)
print(capital_cities)
```

Sets are also useful in finding unique elements in a list. Let's merge the two lists using the `extend()` method. The resulting list will have duplicate elements. Creating a set from the list removes the duplicate elements.


```python
cities.extend(capitals)
print(cities)
print(set(cities))
```

## Dictionaries

In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets **{}**. Dictionaries have *keys* and *values*. With lists, we can access each element by its index. But a dictionary makes it easy to access the element by name. Keys and values are separated by a colon **:**. 


```python
data = {'city': 'San Francisco', 'population': 881549, 'coordinates': (-122.4194, 37.7749) }
print(data)
```

You can access an item of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets.


```python
print(data['city'])
```

## Exercise

From the dictionary below, how do you access the latitude and longitude values? print the latitude and longitude of new york city by extracting it from the dictionary below.

The expected output should look like below.

```
40.661
-73.944
```


```python
nyc_data = {'city': 'New York', 'population': 8175133, 'coordinates': (40.661, -73.944) }
```

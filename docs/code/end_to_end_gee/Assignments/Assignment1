// Assignment
// Export the Night Lights images for May,2015 and May,2020

// Workflow:
// Load the VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites collection
// Filter the collection to the date range
// Extract the 'avg_rad' band which represents the nighttime lights
// Clip the image to the geometry of your city
// Export the resulting image as a GeoTIFF file.

// Hint1: 

// There are 2 VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night collections
// Use the one that corrects for stray light

// Hint2: 

// The collection contains 1 global image per month
// After filtering for the month, there will be only 1 image in the collection

// You can use the following technique to extract that image
// var image = ee.Image(filtered.first())

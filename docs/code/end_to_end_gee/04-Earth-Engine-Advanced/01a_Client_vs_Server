// Client vs. Server

// User Interface elements - Map View, Drawing Tools, Buttons, Sliders etc.
// are 'client-side'. They run in YOUR browser

// Image Collections, feature collections, calculations on Earth Engine objects
// etc. are 'server-side'. They run in Google's data center.

// You cannot mix both these objects.

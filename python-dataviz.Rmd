# Introduction 

This is an intermediate-level course that teaches you how to use Python for creating charts, plots, animations, and maps.

# Get the Data Package

The code examples in this class use a variety of datasets. All the required datasets and Jupyter notebooks are supplied to you in the ``python_dataviz.zip`` file. Unzip this file to a directory - preferably to the ``<home folder>/Downloads/python_dataviz/`` folder. 

*Not enrolled in our instructor-led class but want to work through the material on your own?* [Get free access to the data package](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6TGQmr5w_QlDEgZ7QJrfuiRTu-aCuhfcNY_fYCU3zv9hHOg/viewform){target="_blank"}

# Installation and Setting up the Environment 

This class requires installing Anaconda and creating a new environment named ``python_dataviz`. Please review the [Anaconda Installation Guide](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/python-foundation.html#installation-and-setting-up-the-environment) for step-by-step instructions.

Once you have created and activate the ``python_dataviz`` environment, install the following packages from the `conda-forge` channel.

- ``geopandas``
- ``rasterio``
- ``matplotlib``
- ``jupyterlab``
- ``xarray``
- ``contextily``
- ``cartopy``

Open the command prompt/terminal and run the following conda commands for installation.

```
conda create --name python_dataviz
conda activate python_dataviz
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas rasterio matplotlib jupyterlab xarray contextily cartopy -y
```

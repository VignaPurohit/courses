Using Google Earth Engine requires an approved account. The official instructions for signing-up are in the Earth Engine User Guide. Review the steps outlined at [Earth Engine access](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/access) and follow the instructions below for your account type.

## Non-Commercial Users

Earth Engine is available free of cost for [Noncommercial and Research use](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial/). If you are eligible for non-commercial access, follow the instructions below to obtain an account.

### Option 1: Sign-up using Google Cloud

This is the preferred option for signing up for new Google Earth Engine accounts.

Visit [Project Registration Page](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) and follow the instructions to enable Earth Engine access. You will have to sign-up for Google Cloud and create a new cloud project to be used with Earth Engine.

### Option 2: Sign-up without Google Cloud

Non-commercial users also have an option to use the legacy sign-up page to get a Google Earth Engine account. Some users may not have necessary permissions from their organization to create a cloud project. This option allows you to sign-up without a Google Cloud project.

Visit [https://signup.earthengine.google.com/](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/){target="_blank"} and sign-up with your Google account. You can use your existing gmail account to sign-up. It usually takes 1-2 days for approval. Hence do this step as soon as possible.

Tips to ensure smooth sign-up process:

- Use Google Chrome browser.
- When signing up for Earth Engine, please log out of all Google accounts and ensure you are logged into only 1 account which you want associated with Earth Engine. 
- Prefer using your university/organization email for signing up.
- Access to Google Earth Engine is granted via Google Groups. The default settings should be fine, but verify you have the correct setting enabled.
    - Visit [groups.google.com](http://groups.google.com/){target="_blank"}
    - Click on Settings (gear icon) and select Global Settings.
    - Make sure the option Allow group managers to add me to their groups is checked.

## Commercial Users

Google Earth Engine is available as a Google Cloud service for [Commmercial users](https://earthengine.google.com/commercial/). You need a Google Cloud account to sign-up for Earth Engine.

### New Google Cloud Users

If you haven't used Google Cloud before, visit [Project Registration Page](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) and follow the instructions to enable Earth Engine access.

### Existing Google Cloud Users

If you already use Google Cloud and have an existing project, visit [Getting access](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/access#a-role-in-a-cloud-project) page for instructions.
